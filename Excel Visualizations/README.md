# Excel Visualizations Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project focuses on cleaning a sample dataset on bike sales and using the cleaned data to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard addresses questions such as the age bracket of the most frequent bike purchasers, the average income per purchase by gender, customer commuting patterns, and more.

### Data Sources

Bike Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Bike Sales.xlsx" file, which contains demographic data for customers and whether or not they purchased a bike. The Excel file is provided in the folder for the project, or can be viewed [here](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flkolb10%2FData_Projects%2Fmain%2FExcel%2520Visualizations%2FBike%2520Sales.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK).
